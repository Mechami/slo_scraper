PHYS 42 - Physics for Scientists and Engineers II
Prerequisite(s): PHYS 41, MATH 31
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

4 Unit(s)

This course, intended for students majoring in physical sciences and engineering, is part of a
three-semester course whose contents may be offered in other sequences or combinations. Core topics
include electrostatics, magnetism, DC and AC circuits, and Maxwell’s equations. It is highly
recommended that students also enroll in PHYS 52. (C-ID PHYS 210). Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Analyze simple static charge distributions and calculate the resulting electric field and electric
potential.
B. Analyze simple current distributions and calculate the resulting magnetic field.
C. Predict the trajectory of charged particles in uniform electric and magnetic fields.
D. Analyze DC and AC circuits in terms of current, potential difference, and power dissipation for
each element.
E. Analyze basic physical situations involving reflection and refraction, and use this analysis to
predict the path of a light ray.

IV. METHODS OF INSTRUCTION
A. Lecture
B. Instructor Demonstrations
C. Homework: Students are required to complete two hours of outside-of-class homework for each
hour of lecture
D. Discussion
E. Problem-Solving Sessions
F. Laboratory Experiments
G. Individual Tutoring
V. METHODS OF EVALUATION
A. The evaluation of student progress will be accomplished through the use of written
examinations, tests, quizzes, homework assignments, and a final examination.
B. The evaluation of student laboratory progress will be through laboratory reports.
VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read through the example coulombs law problem. Be prepared to solve a similar problem
in class.
2. Read Feynman's discussion of cargo cult science. Prepare to contrast the development of
Maxwell's equations with other self described sciences.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Write an annotated and complete solution of the electric field around a uniformly charged
thin rod. Include an analysis of the limiting behavior of the solution both near and far
from the rod.
2. Write a thorough report on the determination of the magnetic field of the Earth. Include an
introduction, a paragraph on historical measurements of the Earths magnetic field,

annotated derivations of the underlying relationships used in the experiment and error
analysis.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Calculate the energy usage per month from the lights in your house using the power
ratings on the lights and estimates for the usage. Compare this with the total energy usage
from your PG&E bill. (If you do not have access to such things use the house of a friend
or parents.)
2. Look up the conductivity of silver, gold, copper and steel. Contrast this with glass, paper,
plastic and wood. Be prepared to discuss the rough categorization of materials as
conductors or insulators.
VII. RECOMMENDED MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION
Textbooks:
A. Halliday, D., Resnick, R., & Walker, J.. Fundamentals of Physics Extended. 9th Edition. Wiley,
2011.
Materials Other Than Textbooks:
A. Eggert, S., Trento, J., and White, R.. Physics 42 Lab manual, purchase at the bookstore.
B. Miscellaneous graph paper will be required for experimental write-ups.
C. A scientific calculator is recommended.
