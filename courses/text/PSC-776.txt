COURSE OUTLINE
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
PSC 51 - Weather Lab
Prerequisite(s): PSC 50 (or concurrent enrollment)
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lab

1 Unit(s)

This course will emphasize the practical concepts of physical science and weather using
demonstration and experimentation. Topics include the scientific method, Newton’s laws of motion,
heat and energy transfer, the gas law, and fluid dynamics. Other experiments will demonstrate
weather observation techniques, collection and analysis of atmospheric data, weather map study,
cloud identification, interpretation of satellite imagery, and basic forecasting skills. This course
includes a field trip to a local forecasting facility.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Use the scientific method to investigate and evaluate weather topics and atmospheric issues.
B. Describe and measure the basic weather variables in the atmosphere.
C. Analyze and describe the different types of clouds in the atmosphere.
D. Identify the basic structure and composition of the atmosphere.
E. Evaluate weather observations and maps.
F. Describe basic physical science concepts including Newton’s laws of motion, latent and sensible
heat transfer, and the gas law.
G. Analyze satellite imagery and computer model charts.
H. Synthesize basic forecasting tools and techniques.

acid. Be prepared to take a quiz on the topic of latent heat.
2. In 100 words or less summarize the three sensible heat transfer methods and give
examples of each. Be prepared to perform experiments in lab that test these methods.
