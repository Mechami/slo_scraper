EH 42 - Wine Growing Practices - Spring
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level III; Math Level II
Transfer Status: CSU
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course will teach viticulture practices related to wine grapes for the spring and summer season
including planning and planting a new vineyard, pest control, soils, frost control, irrigation practices,
quality control measures and vineyard equipment use. Emphasis will be placed on practical
applications of viticulture.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Define appropriate process in designing a wine grape vineyard.
B. Illustrate the construction steps and techniques for building a vineyard.
C. Demonstrate proper training technique for young vines and canopy management of older vines.
D. Explain how soil and water quality, nutrition, weather, weeds, insects, diseases, and cultivar
choice contribute to vine health and fruit development.
E. Identify various methods of irrigation and frost protection.
F. Coordinate sample collection and interpret tissue analysis results.
G. Distinguish practical management techniques for ‘boutique’ wineries versus ‘industrial’ level
growers.
III. COURSE CONTENT
A. General Goals
1. This course will teach the steps in selecting rootstocks, trellising/training styles, irrigation
systems and planting the vineyard. We will demonstrate proper training techniques for
young vines, pruning of existing vines and cultural practices in the vineyard for winter and
spring.
