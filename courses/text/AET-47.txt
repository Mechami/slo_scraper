VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the text chapter on shop safety. Prepare for class discussion on what we will need to
do to maintain a safe shop environment.
2. Read the Electrical Notes provided on your class BlackBoard page. Be prepared to discuss
circuit types, rules, and Ohm's Law.
B. Writing Assignments

1. Complete your daily Lab Report to review the topic presented and evaluate your
understanding of it at the end of each class. Return the white copy to the instructor- keep
the pink copy for your reference.
2. In a 2 page paper describe how all the engine components work together to produce
power. Include the effect of forced induction.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Answer the ASE questions at the end of each assigned chapter in the text. These will be
kept in your portfolio to be checked by the instructor.
2. Using internet sources provided investigate the operating principles of power train and
other components. Prepare a single page summation of the purpose, operation, and
component parts of a differential and submit to instructor.
