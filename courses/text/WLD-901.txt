56, WLD 156
Recommended Prep: Reading Level III; English Level II; Math Level II
Transfer Status: NT
51 - 102 hours Lab
This is a supervised lab experience to help prepare students to meet the required standard for
qualification papers in welding codes using American Welding Society (AWS) and American Society
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) specifications. Students will practice skills in shielded metal arc
welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux core are welding (FCAW), and gas tungsten
arc welding (GTAW), in all positions on plate and pipe, in preparation for weld performance tests with
certified welding inspectors (CWI) or contractors. Students may enroll in this course up to 2 unit(s) to
complete the entire curriculum of the course. Pass/No Pass Only. Open Entry/Open Exit.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Follow proper safety protocols when operating welding and cutting equipment.
B. Perform at code level on open groove plate and pipe joints.
C. Demonstrate destructive testing of welds in accordance with the AWS and ASME codes.
D. Follow procedures using the SMAW, GMAW, FCAW, and GTAW welding processes meeting
AWS and ASME specifications for qualification.
