3 Unit(s)

This is an intermediate level course in computer networks that enables students to understand the
selection criteria of network devices and WAN technologies to meet network requirements. The focus
of this course is scaling and connecting networks through WAN technologies. It describes the
architecture, components and advanced operations of routers and switches, and the network services
required by converged applications in a large and complex network. It is the third of three courses
designed to prepare students to take the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam. This
course will provide students with the skills and knowledge required to analyze, design, build, and
maintain small to medium-sized networks; troubleshoot data link and routing protocols and network
services. Topics include: Local Area Network (LAN) switching and design, Virtual Local Area
Networks (VLANs), trunking protocols, wireless concepts and configuration, WAN fundamentals and
protocols, Internet Protocol (IP) addressing services, network security, Access Control Lists (ACLs),
and troubleshooting.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Design, build, configure, and maintain small to medium-sized networks utilizing switches and
WAN connections.
B. Describe and analyze the advantages of LAN segmentation using switches, and routers.
C. Describe and analyze networking congestion and latency problems in an Ethernet network.
D. Describe, explain the benefits of, and configure VLANs.
E. Explain the purpose and use of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
F. Describe the benefits of monitoring a network using Syslog, Simple Network Management
Protocol (SMNP) and NetFlow.
G. Analyze and differentiate between different WAN services: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP),
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), and Frame Relay.
H. Explain basic wireless concepts.
I. Configure a secure site to site connection.
J. Analyze, compare, and configure routing protocols including Frame Relay, Open Shortest Path
First (OSPF) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).
