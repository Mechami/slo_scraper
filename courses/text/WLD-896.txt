WLD 152 - Shop Practices for Intermediate Welders
Prerequisite(s): WLD 20
Recommended Prep: Reading Level III; English Level II; Math Level II
Transfer Status: NT
25.5 - 51 hours Lab

0.5 - 1 Unit(s)

This is a supervised lab experience for intermediate welding students. Students will practice skills in
shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), oxy-fuel cutting (OFC),
plasma arc cutting (PAC),and air carbon arc cutting and gouging (CAC-A). Welding and cutting
processes will be in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions on groove welds with backing
and open V-groove welds. All welds will meet the American Welding Society (AWS) qualification
standards. Students may enroll in this course up to 1 unit(s) to complete the entire curriculum of the
course. Pass/No Pass Only. Open Entry/Open Exit.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Follow proper safety protocols when operating welding and cutting equipment.
B. Operate SMAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
C. Operate GMAW equipment, to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical positions.
D. Operate SMAW equipment on various joint fit-ups and alignment.
E. Use PAC equipment in a safe manner.
F. Use CAC-A equipment in a safe manner.
G. Demonstrate welding skills at a proficiency level appropriate for an intermediate welding
student.
