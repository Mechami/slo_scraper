3 Unit(s)

In this course students will perform layout, fitting, welding, inspection of structural weldments,
piping, tank, and low pressure vessel simulation. Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas tungsten
arc welding (GTAW), and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) processes are emphasized. Shop
fabrication and field erection are simulated. Limited access welding is encountered.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Describe methods of integrated welding applications used in the welding industry.
B. Apply the skills and practices of integrated welding techniques for various fabrication activities.
C. Demonstrate proficient use of equipment and tools related to fabrication and various welding
applications.
D. Implement welding skills thus far developed on coupons and expand these skills to actual
simulated application of the welding industry.
