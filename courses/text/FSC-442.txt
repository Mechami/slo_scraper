1.3 Unit(s)

A study of the role of rescue personnel responding to a Confined Space incident. This course provides
instruction in identifying confined spaces and permit-required confined spaces, the hazards associated
with entering such spaces, target industries that possess these spaces and laws regulating entries/
rescues performed in confined spaces. Participants will be taught the mandatory aspects of confined
space entries and rescues including monitoring, ventilation, lock-out/tag-out, retrieval and
communication systems, respiratory protection, etc. The course is designed for those personnel who
are likely to make routine or rescue entries into confined spaces. Meets CSFM certification
requirements. Pass/No Pass Only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Demonstrate a knowledge of the codes and regulations that impact operations within confined
spaces.
B. Identify confined spaces and permit required confined spaces.
C. Recognize the hazards associated with confined spaces.
D. Evaluate hazardous atmospheres within confined spaces.
E. Demonstrate techniques to evaluate confined spaces.
F. Identify the requirements of entrant retrieval systems.
G. Develop rope and cable retrieval systems.
H. Determine adequate levels of personnel protection.
I. Demonstrate how to mitigate hazards in confined spaces.
J. Recognize the required operational positions and their responsibilities as set forth by
Cal-OSHA.
