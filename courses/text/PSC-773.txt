This course is a study of our dynamic universe. Topics include the history of astronomy, the science of
observation and discovery, stellar birth, maturation and death, planetary formation, a description of
our solar system galaxies, quasars and cosmology.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Describe the basic motion of objects we see in the sky such as the sun, moon, stars, planets,
comets meteors and meteor showers.
B. Discuss the basic history of astronomy to include Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and
Newton as well as the geocentric versus the heliocentric model.
C. Demonstrate an understanding of the basic laws of motion, optics and the electromagnetic
spectrum related to energy, wavelength and spectroscopy.
D. Diagram the solar system and be able to discuss similarities and differences between Earth and
other solar system bodies.
E. Outline the process of energy production in the Sun and the path of travel of this energy to
Earth.
F. Compare and contrast the life cycle of a one solar mass star with a twenty solar mass star.
