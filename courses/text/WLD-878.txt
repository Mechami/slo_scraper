4 Unit(s)

In this course students will perform welds in positions other than flat and horizontal. The content will
enhance the ability of the students to perform welds out of position. The course includes welding
safety, shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), plasma arc cutting
(PAC), air carbon arc cutting and gouging (CAC-A) welding and cutting processes. These welds will
be performed in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions. It will also include base metal,
shielded metal arc welding electrodes, joint fit-up and alignment, groove welds with backing, and
open V-groove welds. All welds will meet the American Welding Society (AWS) qualification
standards.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Operate the SMAW units to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
B. Demonstrate proper joint fit-up and alignment.
C. Demonstrate proper base metal, beads and fillet welds qualification procedures per requirements
set by the AWS.
D. Demonstrate proper welding process of groove welds (with backing and open) per qualification
procedures set by the AWS.
E. Demonstrate the use of the PAC units in a safe manner.
F. Demonstrate the use of the CAC-A unit in a safe manner.
G. Operate the GMAW units, to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical positions.
H. Identify and use the AWS classification of electrodes in selecting the correct electrode for the
job.
