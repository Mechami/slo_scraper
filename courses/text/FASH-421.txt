VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Select an advanced construction technique and read the relevant materials from the class
text. Prepare to discuss and demonstrate techniques and skills needed to develop slopers
with flat patterning and draping techniques.
2. Read the handout on fashion silhouettes for consideration in your own fashion design.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Write a 2 to 3 page report summarizing the process needed to develop a sloper using the
draping method. Explain the difference between flat pattern and draping techniques, plus
the pros and cons of each technique.
2. Write a 2 to 3 page report summarizing the process needed to develop a sloper using the
flat pattern drafting method.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Prepare and present two original designs. Develop a pattern and a finished product for
each design.
2. Develop a comprehensive technique book (approximately 60 pages long), demonstrating
all the flat patterning dart manipulations.
