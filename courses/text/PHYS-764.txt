4 Unit(s)

This course, intended for students majoring in physical sciences and engineering, is part of a
three-semester course whose contents may be offered in other sequences or combinations. Core topics
include optics and modern physics. (C-ID PHYS 43). Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Analyze situations involving interference and diffraction of light waves, and apply these to
situations including double slits, diffraction gratings, and wide slits.
B. Apply basic concepts of quantum mechanics to analyze basic physical setups, including a
particle in a box and simple atomic models.
C. Analyze real-world experimental data, including appropriate use of units and significant figures.
D. Relate the results of experimental data to the physical concepts discussed in the lecture portion
of the class.

IV. METHODS OF INSTRUCTION
A. Lecture
B. Instructor Demonstrations
C. Homework: Students are required to complete two hours of outside-of-class homework for each
hour of lecture
D. Discussion
E. Problem-Solving Sessions
F. Laboratory Experiments
V. METHODS OF EVALUATION
A. The evaluation of student progress will be accomplished through the use of written
examinations, tests, quizzes, homework assignments, and a final examination.
B. The evaluation of student laboratory progress will be through laboratory reports.
VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read "Boltzmann's work in statistical physics". Prepare to participate in a discussion
regarding connecting the macroscopic thermodynamics to the microscopic world of
quantum mechanics.
2. Read the article "A short history of atomic physics in the twentieth century" and prepare
to discuss the seminal experiments performed that elucidated the structure of the atom.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Produce a detailed solution of a quantum mechanical particle in a box. Include a summary
relating standing waves on a string to the descreteness of the energy levels in this
primitive model of the hydrogen atom and the connections to the spectrum of the
Hydrogen atom.
2. Write a detailed report on the Frank-Hertz experiment including a one page introduction, a
brief description of the apparatus, annotated data sheet, calculations and error analysis.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Research the methods for doping in semiconducting materials. Be prepared to give a
overview of the steps requred to fabricate a pn junction.
2. Practice the derivation of the ideal gas law using Newton's laws (Kinetic Theory). Prepare
to reproduce the key steps of this derivation during a quiz.
