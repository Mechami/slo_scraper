17 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

2 Unit(s)

This course is an introduction to applied Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and provides the
knowledge and practical experience necessary to develop skills in the acquisition of Global
Positioning System's (GPS) data and its application to (GIS) for presentation and use in precision
agriculture, field biology/botany, natural resources and park-land management, as well as heavy
equipment operation. No previous GIS experience is assumed.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Use various types of GPS and GIS equipment and software
B. Acquire and store digital GPS data
C. Locate waypoints using maps and GPS equipment
D. Convert GPS data and digital maps from one form to another
E. Apply appropriate projection for a given objective
F. Map engineered grades, landmarks and boundaries
G. Map migration corridors, and temporal home and transitional ranges of wildlife
H. Compile information from GPS data, aerial and topographical maps to analyze and present
spatial configurations of natural resources
