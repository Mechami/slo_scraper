COURSE OUTLINE
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
PSC 21 - Introductory Physical Science Laboratory
Prerequisite(s): PSC 20 (or concurrent enrollment)
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level IV; Math Level IV
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lab

1 Unit(s)

This course will introduce students to the measurements, techniques, and terminology used to describe
the physical environment. Topics include experiments and activities on the scientific method,
Newton’s laws of motion, energy, light and sound. Scientific methods will also be used to study
earthquakes, geologic time, common rocks, and Earth’s atmosphere. This course will supplement
material presented in the Physical Science lecture course.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Use the scientific method to investigate and describe the natural world.
B. Measure the motion of objects, describe the forces acting on those objects, and graph data
related to motion.
C. Describe the energy of a system and the different ways that thermal energy is transferred.
D. Describe the nature of sound and light waves and explain how different sources affect the
character of the waves.
E. Identify and interpret common rocks.
F. Explain geologic processes such as earthquakes, plate tectonics, and geologic dating methods.
G. Determine specific atmospheric variables and relate their measurements to weather phenomena.
