FSC 4 - Fundamentals of Fire Behavior and Control
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level III; English Level III
Transfer Status: CSU
51 hours Lecture

3 Unit(s)

This course introduces students to methods of science and concepts relating to mechanics, heat,
electricity, atomic structure, formula and nomenclature of organic and inorganic compounds for the
purpose of identification of dangerous reactions in emergency incidents. Emphasis is placed on basic
principles, relationships and applications to fire protection.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Explain the nature of matter and energy, including the laws that explain their behavior.
B. Recognize and utilize terminology, definitions and basic principles of chemistry and physics,
especially as they apply to the science of fire.
C. Define heat and describe its sources, forms, methods of transfer and control, especially in fire
situations.
D. Utilize the understanding of the chemistry of fire to develop strategies for fire extinguishment.
