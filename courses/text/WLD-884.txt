3 Unit(s)

This course includes the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) processes and the flux cored arc
welding (FCAW) Process, in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions on heavy plate (3/4”
to 3” thick). It will also include safety procedures, electrode identification, joint fit-up and alignment,
base metal preparation, weld quality, and beads, with focus on theory and practice.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Operate the SMAW units to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions.
B. Operate the FCAW units to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions.
C. Operate the SMAW and FCAW units demonstrating the skill needed to weld heavy plate.
D. Demonstrate proper base metal and bead qualification procedures per requirements set by the
American Welding Society (AWS).
E. Identify and use the AWS classification of electrodes in selecting the correct electrode for the
job.
F. Master the skills needed to pass certification on heavy plate as per the requirements set by the
AWS.
