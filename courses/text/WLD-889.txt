This course instructs on the qualifications and knowledge requirements of a Certified Welding
Inspector (CWI). Methods of testing, various procedures, and techniques of inspection. familiarize
students with the basic concepts of destructive and nondestructive evaluation processes. Emphasis of
record keeping methods used by the American Welding Society (AWS), American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American Petroleum Institute (API), and American National
Standards Institute (ANSI).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Apply testing symbols to weldments according various welding standards.
B. Apply codes to weldments that are currently used in the welding industry.
C. Describe the role of a CWI in fabrication and the qualification of a welder.
