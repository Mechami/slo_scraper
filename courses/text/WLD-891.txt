This course teaches shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux core
arc welding (FCAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), oxyacetylene welding (OAW), and
oxy-fuel cutting (OFC)processes on several piping systems. A variety of materials and configurations
on sub-critical pipe welding to include pressure and power systems, cross-country transmission, water
transmission and pipeline welding will be studied. Special attention and performance to the American
Petroleum Institute (API) 1104 and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section IX
code specifications for certification will be practiced. Intense training in pipe fitting, measurements,
marking and layout tools used in the pipe welding industry will be stressed. Techniques of layout,
cutting, fitting, and welding of various pipe joint designs will be performed.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Correctly utilize the tools used in pipe layout and fitting.
B. Layout various pipe joint designs.
C. Cut, prepare, and weld various pipe joint designs.
D. Layout and cut eccentric and concentric reducers.
E. Apply qualification procedures of the API and ASME for certification.
F. Follow procedures using the OAW, SMAW, GMAW, FCAW, and GTAW welding processees
meeting API and ASME specifications for qualification of welding procedures and the welder
