ENGR 45 - Materials Science
Prerequisite(s): PHYS 41, CHEM 1
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

4 Unit(s)

This course presents the internal structures and resulting behaviors of materials used in engineering
applications, including metals, ceramics, polymers, composites, and semiconductors. The emphasis is
upon developing the ability both to select appropriate materials to meet engineering design criteria and
to understand the effects of heat, stress, imperfections, and chemical environments upon material
properties and performance. Laboratories provide opportunities to directly observe the structures and
behaviors discussed in the course, to operate testing equipment, to analyze experimental data, and to
prepare reports. (C-ID ENGR 140).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Explain the relationship between the internal structure of materials and their macroscopic
properties.
B. Explain methods (intentional or unintentional) of altering the structure of materials by
mechanical, chemical, or thermal means in order to change material properties.
C. Illustrate the various systems for classifying materials, and compare differences in properties
among material classes that derive from differences in structure.
D. Gather data from reference sources regarding the properties, processing, and performance
characteristics of materials, and use it as a basis to recommend appropriate material(s) to meet
engineering design criteria.
E. Measure material properties and/or evaluate processing treatments using standard materials
testing equipment and techniques. (Lab)
F. Write laboratory reports that communicate the collection, analysis, and interpretation of
experimental data according to professional engineering standards. (Lab)

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS

A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the safety procedures in the lab manual and be prepared to apply them in mock
examples presented by the instructor.
2. Read the section in the text defining and contrasting the unit cells of various crystal
structures. Be prepared to use the course periodic table and sketch the crystal structures of
randomly selected single atom solids.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Produce a formal 5-6 page report of the harness testing experiment. The formal lab report
must include a cover page, table of contents, introduction, theory, principles, and
summary/conclusions.
2. Solve selected problems regarding phase diagrams and write one page identifying the
thermodynamic conditions necessary to apply the phase concept.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Solve a series of questions on grain size determination using the ASTM methods
described in class.
2. Go the the MatWeb site and produce a reference list with a short definition of all the
unique material properties on the search menu of the material properties section. Be
prepared to discuss in class.
