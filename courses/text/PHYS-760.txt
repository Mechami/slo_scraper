PHYS 21 - College Physics I
Prerequisite(s): MATH 20 or high school trigonometry
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

4 Unit(s)

This course is intended for students not majoring in physics or engineering but needing a one-year
course in physics as a requirement for their major program. The course is part of a two-semester
sequence whose contents may be offered in other sequences or combinations at articulated
institutions. Topics include kinematics, dynamics, work and energy, momentum, fluids and simple
harmonic motion. (C-ID PHYS 105). Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Predict the future trajectory of an object in two dimension with uniform acceleration.
B. Analyze a physical situation with multiple constant forces acting on a point mass using
Newtonian mechanics.
C. Analyze a physical situation using concept of work and energy.
D. Analyze static and dynamic extended systems using the concepts of torque and angular
acceleration.
E. Analyze real-world experimental data, including appropriate use of units and significant figures.
(Lab)
F. Relate the results of experimental data to the physical concepts discussed in the lecture portion
of the class. (Lab)

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the section on Newton's first law in the text and be prepared to participate in
conceptual questioning.
2. Read through the worked example where the cat is thrown off the high rise building on
Mars. Be prepared to do a similar problem on a quiz.
B. Writing Assignments

1. Write up a proposed lab procedure for determining the acceleration due to gravity near the
earth.
2. Write a critique of a problem you solved that turned out to be wrong. Explain your mistake
and how to solve it correctly.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Find an example "in the wild" of a clear demonstration of the doppler effect and be
prepared to explain to the class.
2. Measure the time it takes for an ice cube to melt in water. Note the important features of
the "experiment" and construct a hypothesis regarding the law of heat flow.
