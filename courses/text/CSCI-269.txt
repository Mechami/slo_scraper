VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the procedure for implementing a disaster recovery scheme. Using the handout
provided by the instructor, create a disaster recovery scheme and summarize the back up,
recovery, and access methods. Be prepared to demonstrate the procedure and steps in class
on your server.
2. Read a TechNet whitepaper on iSCSI. Consider the implications of a compromised iSCSI
host. What are the security ramifications and liability issues? Prepare to discuss in class.
B. Writing Assignments
1. List the steps required to install an Enterprise Certificate Authority (CA) and write a 1-2

page summary of backup and recovery procedures for an Enterprise CA.
2. Using a hypothetical enterprise provided by your instructor, prepare a 1-page outline of a
procedure to implement fault tolerance and redundancy for the enterprise. Your outline
must include your reasoning (2-3 sentences per step) behind each step in the procedure.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Visit the website of VeriSign or another Certificate Authority (CA). Take notes on the
services provided and be prepared to discuss what you learned in class.
2. Research best practices for Active Directory (AD) replication across large geographical
areas. Consider the influence of environmental factors (such as weather), network
infrastructure limitations, and geopolitical issues. Be prepared to present your findings to
the class.
