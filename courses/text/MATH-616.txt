COURSE OUTLINE
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
MATH 31A - Calculus with MAPLE
Prerequisite(s): MATH 30
Co-requisite(s): MATH 31
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
9 hours Lecture
18 hours Lab

1 Unit(s)

This course introduces a student to the MAPLE Symbolic Math Package. This computer program will
be used in a variety of situations, including problem solving, calculus investigations, and “real life”
calculus problems. Mathematical concepts from Math 30 and Math 31 will be used.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Understand MAPLE input and output as it relates to expressions, functions, equations, and
calculus concepts.
B. Use MAPLE to solve applied calculus problems.
C. Use discovery learning to reinforce ideas presented in second semester calculus.
