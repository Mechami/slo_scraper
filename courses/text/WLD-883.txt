3 Unit(s)

This course includes the gas metal arc welding (GMAW)/metal inert gas (MIG), gas tungsten arc
welding (GTAW)/tungsten inert gas (TIG) and flux cored arc welding (FCAW) processes, in the flat,
vertical, horizontal, and overhead positions. It will also include safety procedures, electrode
identification, joint fit-up and alignment, base metal preparation, weld quality, and beads, with a focus
on theory and practice.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Operate the GMAW units to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions.
B. Operate the FCAW units to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions.
C. Operate the GTAW units to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions.
D. Operate the GMAW, FCAW, and GTAW processes, demonstrating the skill needed for
certification.
E. Demonstrate proper base metal and bead qualification procedures per requirements set by the
American Welding Society (AWS).
F. Identify and use the AWS classification of electrodes, wires, and rod when selecting the correct
electrode for the job.
G. Master the skills needed to pass certification as per the requirements set by the AWS.
