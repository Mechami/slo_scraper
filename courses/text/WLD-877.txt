WLD 20 - Beginning Welding
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level III; English Level II; Math Level II
Transfer Status: CSU
17 hours Lecture
153 hours Lab

4 Unit(s)

This course includes oxyacetylene welding (OAW), oxyacetylene cutting (OFC-A) and shielded metal
arc welding (SMAW) processes, in the flat and horizontal positions on various joint details. It will also
include safety procedures, electrode identification, joint fit-up and alignment, base metal preparation,
weld quality, beads and fillet welds, with focus on theory and practice. All welds will meet the
American Welding Society (AWS) qualification standards.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Operate the OAW unit for welding and cutting in the flat position, in a safe manner.
B. Operate the SMAW units to weld in the flat and horizontal positions.
C. Operate the SMAW units on various joint fit-ups and alignment.
D. Demonstrate proper welding process of groove welds (with backing and open) per qualification
procedures set by the AWS.
E. Demonstrate proper base metal, beads and fillet welds qualification procedures per requirements
set by the AWS.
F. Identify and use the AWS classification of electrodes in selecting the correct electrode for the
job.
