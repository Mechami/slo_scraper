I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
ENGL 60 - Creative Writing: Fiction
Prerequisite(s): ENGL 2
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU
51 hours Lecture

3 Unit(s)

This course develops an awareness of literary fiction as an art form both through the reading of short
works of fiction and writing of exercises and complete stories. Emphasis is placed on the development
of essential elements necessary for the writing of fiction and on the workshop format as a method for
developing understanding and analysis of fiction. The assignments are interconnected in order to help
students incorporate the skills they are practicing into increasingly difficult pieces. Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Analyze works of fiction both canonical and original, identifying elements of plot, character,
dialog, setting, point of view, and style.
B. Identify forms of figurative language and style in their readings of published short fiction and
apply these terms accurately to new works, including those by students in the class.
C. Develop ability to employ figurative language and an artistic voice in their own original work.
D. Participate in workshops in which students provide each other with critical estimations of their
work.
E. Begin and complete projects of complexity and length -- for example, two short stories or
chapters of a novel.
F. Develop the ability to use elements of fiction such as scene, plot, dialog, character, setting, and
point of view in their original exercises and longer works of fiction.
