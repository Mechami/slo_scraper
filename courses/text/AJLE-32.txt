This 28-week course is the third in a series of courses designed to prepare the student for a career as a
peace officer under the authority of the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and
Training (P.O.S.T.). The Level I Module Academy is the final phase of training for individuals
wishing to become California peace officers. As a result, only those who have previously completed
Level II and Level III module training will be eligible to attend this course. Butte College does not
currently offer the Level II and Level III module courses. The curriculum covers 27 learning domains
ranging from academic subjects on criminal law, investigation and patrol procedures to psycho-motor
skills on defensive tactics, firearms training, driving skills and officer-violator contacts. The successful
completion of this course will allow the student to be employed as a peace officer in California (valid
for three years after graduation) and lead to the issuance of a Basic Law Enforcement Certificate from
P.O.S.T. after one year of approved field service at a law enforcement agency. Graded only.
