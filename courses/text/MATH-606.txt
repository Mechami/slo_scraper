68 hours Lecture

4 Unit(s)

This course develops mathematical topics needed for elementary school teaching with a focus on
reasoning, problem solving, and communication. The topics include elementary statistics and
probability, two- and three-dimensional geometry, measurement, coordinate geometry, and graphing.
Meets requirements for elementary school teacher certification.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Organize, summarize, and interpret statistical data.
B. Implement the rules of probability to an experiment.
C. Illustrate the correct use of vocabulary and properties in the study of plane and solid geometry.
D. Solve basic geometry problems using basic algebraic and geometric rules, formulas, and
procedures.
E. Use basic concepts of measurement, including standard (metric & English) and non-standard
units.
F. Solve problems using coordinate geometry.
