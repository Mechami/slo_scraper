the criteria on the checklist, evaluate each of the web sites you are using in your research.
Submit your evaluations to the instructor and be prepared to discuss in class.
B. Writing Assignments

APA citation style as appropriate. In your annotations, include a one paragraph
commentary on the main argument or focus of each resource, and a five sentence
summary of how the resource can help a reader understand key issues related to your
topic.
2. Write a 2-3 page paper on a topic of your choice. Include information from at least one
book, one web site, and two scholarly journal articles from the Library's online databases
in your research. Use in-text citations and a Works Cited/References page in APA or

C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Complete the Butte College Library's online â€œResearch Paper Learning Module," taking
notes. For each section of the module, write a one page summary (in your own words) of
the key points presented in the module and describe how you can use this information to
help you write your paper.
2. Visit a library (other than the Butte College Library) in your community. This may be
either a local public library or the CSUC Meriam Library. Gather information about the
Library's hours and what kinds of information about local history can be found in the
library. Take notes or bring back examples of any guides to help you use the Library for
local history, plus any questions you had. You will use these notes to give a 2-5 minute
presentation to the class, including an overview of the library's offerings, insights you
gained, and what you found of most value from your visit.
