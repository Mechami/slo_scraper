A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the chapter in your text that covers “globalization.” Discuss this concept in class as it
applies to mass communication.

Systems” model. For class be prepared to discuss “core zones,” “semiperiphery zones,”
and “periphery zones,” including how these concepts guide a discussion of globalization.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Write a research paper (1000 words) focusing on constructivist vs. universalist models for
international diplomacy. Pick a developing region somewhere in the world (e.g. North
Africa, the Amazon Basin, Myanmar) and speculate as to how each of the divergent
models above might influence political and economic diplomacy for your chosen region.
2. Write a short essay (2-3 pages) about the geopolitics of Syria. Note how recent conflicts
within Syria have impacted the larger geopolitical tensions of the region (the Middle
East).
