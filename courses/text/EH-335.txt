EH 24 - Spring Plant Identification
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level III; Math Level II
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course is a study of identification, growth habits, culture and ornamental use of spring landscape
and indoor plants adapted to climates of California. Plants emphasized will come from the current
California Association of Nurseries and Garden Centers (CANGC) and California Landscape
Contractors Association (CLCA) Certification Test Plant Lists. This course covers those plants best
observed and studied in the spring of the year. (C-ID AG-EH 112L).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Explain the binomial method of plant nomenclature.
B. Utilize plant identification terminology to identify by leaf, bark, flower, fruit and growth habit.
C. Describe the importance of understanding soil requirements, cultural practices and ecology of
different spring plants.
D. Recognize the various growth habits, environmental requirements and uses of spring plants.
E. Select and specify spring plants which fit selected criteria such as drought tolerance, deer
resistance, and sun or shade requirements.
F. Use plant dichotomous keys to identify collected and preserved plant materials.
G. Demonstrate the use of computerized plant selection programs.
H. Develop a plant characteristics key for future design work.

IV. METHODS OF INSTRUCTION
A. Lecture
B. Instructor Demonstrations
C. Field Trips
D. Homework: Students are required to complete two hours of outside-of-class homework for each
hour of lecture
E. Laboratory: Each week the students will be introduced to 15 new plants selected by the
instructor. The students will be encouraged to take samples for their collection to study. During
the 'plant walk', students will have the opportunity to see the plants growing in the landscapes
and in containers.
V. METHODS OF EVALUATION
A. Exams/Tests
B. Quizzes
C. Homework
D. Class participation
E. Student participation and weekly involvement. There will be a weekly test on (30) different
plant species requiring correct identification and spelling of botanical and common names.
F. Laboratory: This portion of the course consists of the weekly 'plant walk', collection of
specimens and data research for completion of the plant identification sheets for the class
binders.
VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the textbook chapter on USDA hardiness zones and heat summation regions. Prepare
to discuss in small groups in class.
2. Read the chapter of plant taxonomy and use of dichotomous keys for specimen
identification. Use the keys in class to identify unknown species in a class activity.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Prepare a binder of 200 specimen identification cards. Each card should list the 40
environmental requirements for that species.
2. Write a 2-3 page page paper about an ornamental plant family of your choice. Your paper
should include details such sun and shade requirements, growth characteristics, use as a
pollinizer, etc.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments

C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Attend a walking tour of Estates Drive, Chico, CA to view, identify, and comment on
cultural care of specimens from the course ID list. Submit a written description of your
walking tour including a minimum of 150 specimens.
2. Attend a field trip to Sank Park in Oroville, CA to identify specimens in an institutional
setting. Submit an ID list of specimens viewed.
VII. RECOMMENDED MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION
