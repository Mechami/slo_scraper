4 Unit(s)

This course covers shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), gas
metal arc welding (GMAW), and flux core arc welding (FCAW) processes on several pipe systems. A
variety of materials and configurations on sub critical pipe welding (pressure and power systems,
cross-country transmission, pipeline welding and water transmission pipe welding) will be used.
Special attention and performance standards for the qualifications will be used from the following
codes: American Petroleum Institute (API), American Welding Society (AWS) and American Society
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Weld pipe and tube in 2G, 5G and 6G position using all the following processes: SMAW,
GMAW, GTAW, and FCAW.
B. Apply qualifications procedures of the API, AWS, ASME codes for certification.
C. Follow procedures using the SMAW, GMAW, GTAW and FCAW welding processes meeting
API, AWS, and ASME specifications for qualification of welding procedures and the welder.
