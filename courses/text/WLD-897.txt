51 - 102 hours Lab

1 - 2 Unit(s)

This is a supervised lab experience for first semester welding program students. Students will practice
skills in oxyacetylene welding (OAW), oxy-fuel cutting (OFC), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW),
gas metal arc welding (GMAW), and flux core arc welding (FCAW) in all positions (flat, vertical,
horizontal and overhead). Students will also use a variety of freehand and automatic burning
equipment including plasma arc cutting (PAC) units and air carbon arc cutting and gouging (CAC-A)
units. Students may enroll in this course up to 2 unit(s) to complete the entire curriculum of the course.
Pass/No Pass Only. Open Entry/Open Exit.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Follow proper safety protocols when operating welding and cutting equipment.
B. Operate OAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
C. Operate SMAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
D. Operate GMAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
E. Operate FCAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
F. Demonstrate the use OFC equipment in a safe manner.
G. Demonstrate the use of PAC equipment in a safe manner.
