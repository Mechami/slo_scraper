COURSE OUTLINE
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
ENGR 3 - Plane Surveying I
Prerequisite(s): MATH 20 or high school trigonometry
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

The course applies theory and principles of plane surveying: office computations and design;
operation of surveying field equipment; and production of engineering plans/maps. Topics include
distances, angles, and directions; differential leveling; traversing; property/boundary surveys;
topographic surveys/mapping; volume/earthwork; horizontal and vertical curves; land description
techniques; and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Extensive field work using tapes, levels, transits,
theodolites, total stations, and GPS. (C-ID ENGR 180).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Perform office computations and design for differential leveling; traversing; area calculations;
property/boundary surveys; topographic surveys/mapping; volume/earthwork; horizontal and
vertical curves; and error analysis.
B. Operate survey equipment: tape, level, transit, theodolite, compass, total station, GPS.
C. Reduce field notes using various mathematical techniques to generate meaningful records
describing horizontal and vertical control of landforms.
D. Plot plans and maps from field work data using manual and computer-aided drafting.
E. Work effectively in groups during field surveying and engineering design project which involve
problem solving, report writing, and oral presentations.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS

A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the section of your text on differential leveling and be prepared to discuss the theory
of leveling, its benefits and limitations.
2. Read the section of your text on error analysis and extra study materials provided by the
instructor and be prepared to discuss the theory of errors in observations and the error
propagation.
B. Writing Assignments
1. The final entry in your surveying fieldbook will be a complete traverse of the quad,
amphitheater, and tennis courts near the Butte College Quad. Be sure to include all
bearings and distances, closures, and areas.
2. Using your surveying fieldbook summarize all measurements taken in the field and
calculate all closures in latitude and departure.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Calculate northing and easting of assigned surveying points by hand and by use of a
spreadsheet and calculate the area of an assigned closed traverse. Perform the appropriate
arithmetic checks.
2. Complete a set of differential leveling field notes and perform all the appropriate
arithmetical checks.
