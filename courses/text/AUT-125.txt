3 Unit(s)

This course provides theory and principles of operation in automatic transmissions/transaxles, to
include diagnostic, testing and repair of each system.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Correctly identify transmission types and perform routine service procedures including fluid
exchange and external adjustments.
B. Remove and replace both front and rear wheel drive automatic transmissions/transaxles.
C. Identify internal automatic transmission components using industry terminology and
demonstrate an understanding of powerflow through the various planetary components.
D. Perform tests on automatic transmissions and transaxles using pressure gauges and scan tools to
identify external or internal transmission/transaxle problems.
E. Tear down and reassemble transmissions using industry specific publications and determine a
"good" part from a "bad" part prior to reassembly.
