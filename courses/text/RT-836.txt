85 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

6 Unit(s)

This course is a study of the fundamentals of respiratory care in the critical care setting. Emphasis is
placed on the critical care environment, advanced patient assessment, monitoring, advanced
techniques of airway management and continuous mechanical ventilatory support. Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Perform advanced clinical assessment, within the laboratory environment, of simulated acutely
ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
B. Explain the fundamental operational principles of mechanical ventilators.
C. Demonstrate, within the laboratory environment, the ability to operate mechanical ventilators.
D. Demonstrate, within the laboratory environment, the ability to provide respiratory care to
simulated patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
E. Demonstrate the ability to perform acute care respiratory care procedures within the laboratory
environment.
F. Demonstrate the ability to effectively communicate with fellow students and other health care
personnel within the classroom and laboratory environments.
