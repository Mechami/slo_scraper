CSCI 3 - Introduction to Computer Science
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level IV; Math Level III
Transfer Status: CSU
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

In this course, students develop knowledge and skills of the fundamentals of Computer Science.
Topics covered include number systems, computer hardware and software, computer networks,
introductory programming and algorithms, file systems and databases, artificial intelligence and the
theory of computation. Hardware overview covers computer memory, the control unit and Arithmetic
Logic Unit (ALU), and computer Input/Output (I/O). Software overview covers operating systems,
programming languages, applications, and software tools.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Identify data represented in various number bases.
B. Identify and describe the function of the control unit, ALU, and memory, and other computer
hardware.
C. Identify and describe the functions of computer software including operating systems,
programming languages, and various applications.
D. Define basic networking and database concepts.
E. Implement basic computer algorithms and design and implement basic applications using a
modern computer programming language.
F. Solve basic problems in computational theory.
G. Identify the social, legal, and ethical issues of computer scientists and develop an understanding
of the personal responsibilities of computer scientists.
