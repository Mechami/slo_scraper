3 Unit(s)

This is a computer-based drafting course that introduces the student to architectural drafting
applications. Building on basic drafting concepts learned previously, this course will introduce
residential design concepts including floor plans, foundation plans and details, elevations, framing and
section plans, mechanical, electrical and plumbing plans and engineering site plans. Students will also
be introduced to three-dimensional (3D) architectural modeling. Students will prepare a plan set
including coversheet, site plan, floor plan, electrical plan, elevations, building section and construction
details using AutoCAD.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Prepare a residential floor plan within project limits including the consideration of basic
building codes, interior design criteria, room relationships, and traffic patterns.
B. List site plan criteria and prepare a plot plan based on project requirements using engineering
units.
C. List the common foundation systems used for residential projects and prepare a foundation plan
with typical details.
D. List roof types and materials used for residential projects and draw a sample roof plan.
E. Prepare elevation drawings for a residential project.
F. List and describe the major components in supplemental floor plans including electrical,
plumbing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning and draw a sample supplemental floor plan
(electrical).
G. Demonstrate plotting, printing and assembling completed architectural drawings for a residential
project into a finished set of plans.
