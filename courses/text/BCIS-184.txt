BCIS 62 - Introduction to Medical Coding
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level III; Math Level II and ALH
104
Transfer Status: CSU
51 hours Lecture

3 Unit(s)

This course introduces students to procedural and diagnostic coding used in physiciansâ€™ offices.
Through analysis of case histories and surgical reports, students will learn to distinguish between
primary and secondary diagnoses codes, to assign the proper procedural codes, and to explain the
importance of accurate medical documentation and clinical records. Students will gain familiarity with
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Diseases--9th Revision;
Clinical Modification (ICD-9CM); and ICD-10CM code books; guidelines to be followed; and
required supporting documents.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Examine Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's (HIPAA) role in determining
reimbursement and compliance in the medical office.
B. Identify and describe the main components of outpatient coding.
C. Contrast the components of ICD-9-CM coding with ICD-10-CM coding.
D. Identify and describe CPT and the Level II National Codes (HCPCS) and the part each plays in
medical office coding.
E. Explain the differences in the skills needed for Inpatient Coding as compared with outpatient
coding.
F. Code patient diagnoses and treatments using ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, CPT, and HCPCS codes.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read an operative report on a patient. Identify the appropriate codes for the primary
surgery portion.
2. Read the information titled "ICD-10-CM Outpatient Coding and Reporting Guidelines".
Using the ICD-10-CM, identify the correct code for a list of 10 diagnoses.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Using a problem-focused patient's history and examination, determine the diagnosis and
management options, the risks if left untreated, the level of decision-making complexity,
and the correct CPT code for the case. Write a one-page paper explaining your answers.
2. In a one-page paper describe how hospital coding differs from medical office coding.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Interview a medical coder employed in a doctor's office. Write a one-page paper
describing a typical day in the medical office. Include any recommendations the coder
offers about being successful in the field.
2. Do an online search to find out what testing programs are available and how much training
is needed to become a certified medical coder. Be prepared to share your findings in class.
