This course is a survey of cardiorespiratory disease with a focus on the role that the respiratory care
practitioner plays in professional and culturally appropriate clinical assessment, diagnosis, and
treatment. Cultural awareness, sensitivity and communication will be emphasized. Selected respiratory
care techniques, equipment, and procedures will be introduced in the laboratory. Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Explain the importance of professionalism and culturally sensitive patient interactions during
the delivery of respiratory care.
B. Explain the importance of the concept of health promotion, and demonstrate how to provide
effective patient education.
C. Employ basic pre-treatment physical assessment at the bedside of a patient requiring respiratory
care, including appropriate patient education based on the situation.
D. List and explain the importance of the professional organizations and licensing agencies
associated with practice of respiratory care
E. Acces medical literature pertinent to the care of the patient with cardiopulmonary disease.
F. Explain the etiology, signs and symptoms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and common medical
treatment of selected cardiopulmonary diseases.
G. Administer, with minimal supervision, the respiratory care treatment modalities practiced in the
laboratory including appropriate patient education based on the situation.
H. Demonstrate a basic understanding of chest x-ray interpretation, and basic ECG pattern
recognition.
