This is a supervised lab experience for second semester welding program students. Students will
practice skills in gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), flux cored arc
welding (FCAW), and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) on a variety of materials in the flat,
vertical, horizontal, and overhead positions. Students may enroll in this course up to 2 unit(s) to
complete the entire curriculum of the course. Pass/No Pass Only. Open Entry/Open Exit.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Follow proper safety protocols when operating welding and cutting equipment.
B. Operate GMAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
C. Operate FCAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
D. Operate GTAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
E. Operate SMAW equipment to weld in the flat, horizontal, vertical and overhead positions.
F. Operate SMAW and FCAW equipment to weld heavy plate.
G. Weld pipe and tube in 2G, 5G and 6G position using SMAW, GMAW, GTAW, and FCAW
processes.
H. Demonstrate welding skills at a level appropriate for a second semester welding program
student.
