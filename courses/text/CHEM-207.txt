COURSE OUTLINE
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
CHEM 110 - Introductory Chemistry
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level IV; Math Level IV
Transfer Status: NT
51 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

4 Unit(s)

This course is for the student who lacks the necessary background to enroll directly in CHEM 51 or
CHEM 1. The assumption is made that this is the student’s first exposure to chemistry. With that in
mind, both the philosophy and practice of laboratory chemistry are pursued. The approach to many
topics is quantitative and the topics chosen are those that are bothersome to students in more advanced
courses. The goal is to prepare students for CHEM 51 or CHEM 1 and further study in chemistry.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. explain the concepts of scientific thought and the scientific method.
B. demonstrate the predictive nature of science.
C. describe with basic understanding, chemical principles identified in the unit titles.
D. demonstrate appropriate calculation and problem-solving skills.
E. demonstrate basic laboratory skills, including lab safety.
