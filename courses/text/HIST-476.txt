VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the primary and secondary source documents in Chapter 20, "Enlightenment and
Revolution." In what ways did the Enlightenment shape the goals of political revolutions?
Be prepared to address this question in class, and to reference the documents in
formulating your response.
2. Read Chapter Seventeen, "Atlantic Revolutions and Their Echoes." As you read, take
notes in response to the questions in the chapter margins. You will submit your notes for
credit, and the questions will be the basis of an in-class quiz and discussion.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Craft a well-developed research question on a topic in World History that fits within the
timeframe of this course. Recall that it's to be expected that your question will evolve and
mature during the research process. At the top of your paper, write the final version of
your question. In a formal paper between 1000-1250 words in length, summarize your
findings on your research question. The paper should be thoughtfully organized, with an
introduction, body, and conclusion, and logical and proper use of paragraphs. In your
essay, include specific and accurate information and examples from the sources that
reinforce the key observations presented. Details and facts in your essay must be cited
throughout, using proper format style.
You must also prepare an annotated bibliography that includes a minimum of three
sources. For each source, write a substantial paragraph in which you briefly describe the
source, how it is useful to your research, and why you consider it appropriate for use in
college work. Be sure that your annotated bibliography also adheres to proper format

style.
2. In our study of world history between the years 1750 and 1914, a theme has been the
emergence of "modern" human society. What distinguishes modern world history from
earlier eras of human history? In essay form, identify and explain at least three specific
features of modern human society.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Pick a foreign country that will be the focus of your research over the course of the
semester. Identify a research problem or question with respect to the history of your
chosen country. Using Internet resources, newspaper archives, and published documents,
build an annotated primary source collection related to your research problem/question.
2. For this assignment, students will glimpse a foreign land or people through a cultural
artifact -- for example: art, music, food, a game, a foreign film, literature (including
comics), or clothing. As you view, read, or play, look for things that the artifact reveals
about the country, people, and time that it represents. Consider values, geography,
aesthetics, historical events, daily life, class, gender, and so forth. Conduct research to
find the answers to questions raised by the artifact, or to flesh out greater details about one
or more of your observations. You will turn in a written summary, and will share your
findings with the class through a brief demonstration or speech.
