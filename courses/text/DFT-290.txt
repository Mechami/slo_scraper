I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
DFT 12 - Beginning AutoCAD Drafting
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level III; Math Level III
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course introduces students to basic drafting concepts using both freehand sketching and
AutoCAD, an industry-standard computer-aided drafting (CAD) application. It is intended for drafting
majors, engineering majors, interior design majors and pre-architectural students. Topics include line
and geometric shape development, freehand sketching, basic AutoCAD commands, text commands,
file management, orthographic and pictorial projection, dimensioning, sectioning, auxiliaries, and
architectural drawings using sketching and a two-dimensional (2D) drafting application. Document
reproduction, printing and plotting will be introduced and practiced.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Create representative freehand sketches of objects using lines, curves and circles to create
technical shapes using orthographic and pictorial techniques.
B. Properly setup AutoCAD with drafting settings to create, edit and save drawing files.
C. Draw, edit and dimension freehand sketches or technical details, using AutoCAD including the
control of software options and creation of paper-based prints.
D. Produce, edit and dimension orthographic projection drawings, pictorial drawings in mechanical
and architectural applications using AutoCAD.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Please read the section in your text about dimension applications and be prepared to
answer questions from the reading at the next class.
2. Please read the chapter on Section Views. Consider the question "Why are section views
important to drafting?" and be prepared to discuss at the start of next class.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Complete the instructor-led exercise on drafting parameters in class, and write a brief
summary of the parameters used to prepare your DWG file for submission.
2. Having read the chapter on Section Views, write complete answers to the worksheet
questions and submit to the instructor when complete.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Prepare a freehand sketch of the kitchen floorplan provided by the instructor and submit

your sketch at the next class meeting.
2. For extra credit, please search the acronym NIST and the term ISO and prepare
hand-written definitions for each and turn in at the start of the next class. No late
submissions will be accepted.
