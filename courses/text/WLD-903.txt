I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
WLD 164 - Welding Recertification Practices
Prerequisite(s): WLD 160 or WLD 162
Recommended Prep: Reading Level III; English Level II; Math Level II
Transfer Status: NT
12.75 - 51 hours Lab

0.25 - 1 Unit(s)

This is a supervised lab experience to help students recertify to meet the required standard for
qualification papers in welding codes using American Welding Society (AWS), American Petroleum
Institute (API) 1104, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section IX. Students
will practice skills in shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux core
arc welding (FCAW), gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), oxyacetylene welding (OAW) processes on
plate and several piping systems in preparation for weld performance tests with certified welding
inspectors (CWI) or contractors. Students may enroll in this course up to 1 unit(s) to complete the
entire curriculum of the course. Pass/No Pass Only. Open Entry/Open Exit.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Follow proper safety protocols when operating welding and cutting equipment.
B. Cut, prepare, and weld various plate and pipe joint designs.
C. Perform at code level welds on open groove plate and pipe joints.
D. Demonstrate destructive testing of welds in accordance with the AWS, API, and ASME codes
E. Follow procedures using the SMAW, GMAW, FCAW, GTAW, and OAW processes meeting
AWS, API, and ASME specifications for qualification.
