VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the manual (man) page for the grep utility, taking note of the options that are
available when executing this command. Be prepared to write grep commands to solve a
series of problems in class.
2. Read the article "In the Beginning was the Command Line" by Neal Stephenson. Be
prepared to discuss the culture of Linux as presented by Stephenson, in particular the
"Egypt analogy" and the Debian distribution.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Write a one-page vi "starter guide" for a person who has never used the vi editor. In your
guide, include a brief description of the history and key features of vi and an annotated list
of the vi commands you consider to be most important for a new user to learn.
2. Using the Linux Foundation's "Linux Jobs Report" as a starting place, and Internet
research to gather additional information, write a 1-2 page report detailing the current
demand for Linux professionals in the workforce, and the specific Linux skills required of
these professionals.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments

C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Locate and select a BSD distribution to install in your VMWare Workstation or VMWare
Fusion client. After installation, explore the basic configuration options and
command-line utilities of the BSD system. Be prepared to discuss the differences and
similarities between BSD and the Linux system we use in class.
2. Design and implement a shell script to perform a backup of your home directory and all of
its contents, including all directories, sub-directories, hidden files, and non-hidden files.
Your script should compress the backup into a tarball. Test your script thoroughly and be
prepared to demonstrate your working script in class.
