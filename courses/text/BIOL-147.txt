4 Unit(s)

Study of the physiological principles, function, integration and homeostasis of the human body at the
cellular, tissue, organ, organ system and organism level: integumentary system, bone, skeletal, smooth
and cardiac muscles, nervous system, sensory organs, cardiovascular system, lymphatic and immune
systems, respiratory system, urinary system, digestive system, endocrine system, and reproductive
system. This course is primarily intended for Nursing, Allied Health, Kinesiology, and other health
related majors. (C-ID BIOL 120B).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Describe and distinguish various roles of major classes of biomolecules in living cells.
B. Describe key functional features of different types of human cells and how they communicate.
C. Identify key functions of major organ systems and the physiological mechanisms underlying
their operation.
D. Demonstrate an understanding of how organ systems of the body are integrated and regulated.
E. Demonstrate an understanding of how homeostasis is maintained in the body.
F. Demonstrate knowledge of metabolic and physiological disorders of the major organ systems.
G. Analyze experimental data to demonstrate physiological principles.
H. Demonstrate an understanding of the scientific method, experimental design, and the philosophy
of science. Apply the scientific method and philosophy of science by designing components of
and carrying out physiological experiments.

B. Instructor Demonstrations
C. Class Activities
D. Reading Assignments
E. Multimedia Presentations
F. Laboratory Experiments
G. Homework: Students are required to complete two hours of outside-of-class homework per week
for each course unit
V. METHODS OF EVALUATION
A. Quizzes
B. Class participation
C. Lab Projects
D. Written Assignments
E. Midterm and final examinations that include a written component which requires students to
effectively communicate comprehension of material presented and critical thinking skills
F. Laboratory practical exams
VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read through the information given on hormone axes. Be prepared to design a chart that
will be used to determine exposure to unknown hormones.
2. Read through the chapter section on electrical activity in myocardial cells. Be prepared to
compare and contrast between skeletal myofibers, contractile myocardial cells, and nodal
cells.
B. Writing Assignments
1. For each of the skeletal myofiber structures listed in the assignment indicate 1) where it is
found or describe its structure, 2) indicate its specific role in the contraction process, and
3) make a prediction on how the contraction process would be altered if the structure were
missing or non-functional.
2. Watch a movie or television series that utilizes scientific or medical terminology. Prepare
a short, 250 word critique on the writer's accuracy in usage of proper terminology.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Kats (GHK) equation, calculate the membrane voltage for
each of the conditions listed: changes in ECF sodium concentration [Na]out, changes in
ECF potassium concentration [K]out, changes in sodium permeability (PNa), and changes
in potassium permeability (PK).
2. Look at the ingredient labels for various foods or drinks found at a grocery store.
Research an ingredient that is unfamiliar to you then be prepared to discuss what you have
learned at the next class meeting.
