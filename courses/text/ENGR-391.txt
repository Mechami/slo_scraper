ENGR 4 - Plane Surveying II
Prerequisite(s): ENGR 3
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course introduces students to civil engineering design standards, concepts and procedures related
to transportation engineering and construction management. Topics include the standards and design
of horizontal curves, vertical curves and earthwork related to transportation projects in addition to
survey staking, state plane coordinates, geographic information systems and Global Positioning
Systems (GPS) related to project surveying. The laboratory portion of the course includes the
application of 3-dimensional graphic modeling software requiring creativity in design, development of
construction plans, and operation of modern surveying equipment, such as total stations and GPS.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Collect and analyze survey point data (raw field data).
B. Prepare a digital terrain model with Civil 3D software of existing surface and site conditions.
C. Design proposed alignments in accordance with Department of transportation and local
municipality standards.
D. Use Civil 3D software for computing earthwork quantities, material takeoffs and cost estimates
for projects.
E. Produce sets of design plans and specifications for projects such as Class I bike path, residential
cul-de-sac.
F. Stakeout projects in field, document fieldwork and discuss proposed project alignments
specifying vertical and horizontal curves.
