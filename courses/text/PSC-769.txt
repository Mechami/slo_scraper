4 Unit(s)

An introduction to the essentials of Earth Science with a laboratory. Topics include the geosphere,
atmosphere, hydrosphere, and solar system. This course focuses on the interactions between physical
and chemical systems of the Earth such as the tectonic cycle, rock cycle, hydrologic cycle, weather
and climate. (C-ID GEOL 121).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Explain and practically apply the principles of the scientific method.
B. Demonstrate a fundamental understanding of and be able to practically apply concepts,
principles and interactions of Earth’s systems including: Hydrologic Cycle, Rock Cycle,Plate
Tectonics Cycle, Solar System, Geologic Time and Weather and Climate.
C. Be able to explain basic properties of minerals and rocks and to identify representative samples.
D. Explain the processes that shape the Earth and how they change over geologic time.
E. Communicate complex course concepts effectively in writing and diagrams.
