25.5 - 51 hours Lab
This is a supervised lab experience for pipe and tube welders. Students will practice skills in shielded
metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux core arc welding (FCAW), gas
tungsten arc welding (GTAW), oxyacetylene welding (OAW), and oxy-fuel cutting (OFC) processes
on several piping systems. Performance standards will meet the American Petroleum Institute (API)
1104 and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section IX. Students may enroll in this
course up to 1 unit(s) to complete the entire curriculum of the course. Pass/No Pass Only. Open
Entry/Open Exit.
II. OBJECTIVES
