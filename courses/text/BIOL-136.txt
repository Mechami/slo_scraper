4 Unit(s)

This course is a survey of the basic principles and concepts used by biologists to explain how
organisms live and survive. Topics include ecology, a survey of the worlds organisms, genetics,
evolution, cell structure and function, and energy conversions.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Apply the scientific method and recognize it as a distinctive way of knowing.
B. Identify the basic structures common to most cells and explain their function.
C. Compare and contrast the steps of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
D. Describe how any organism is taxonomically classified.
E. Provide an overview of the 3 domains of life which considers contrasts and similarities.
F. Explain how the structure of the major groups of plants and animals is directly related to
function and ultimately the organisms way of survival.
G. Explain the basic mechanism of Darwinian natural selection.
H. Describe the work of Gregor Mendel, his basic genetic laws, and how they apply to basic
human traits.
I. Explain the basic ecological principles that bind an ecosystem together.
