3 Unit(s)

This course prepares students for qualifications in several codes to meet the required standards for
entry-level employment. Training in shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas tungsten arc welding
(GTAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), and flux core arc welding (FCAW) to meet the American
Welding Society (AWS), American Petroleum Institute (API), and American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ASME) code standards. Skills and proficiencies of all positions qualification test on plate
and pipe are emphasized.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Apply qualification procedures in the previously developed training processes for groove and
fillet welds.
B. Apply qualification procedures in several codes to meet the required standard for entry-level
employment.
C. Complete welder qualification tests using various codes, filler materials, base materials, and
welding processes.
