I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
WLD 162 - Pipe and Tube Welding Certification Practices
Prerequisite(s): WLD 55, WLD 158
Recommended Prep: Reading Level III; English Level II; Math Level II
Transfer Status: NT
51 - 102 hours Lab

1 - 2 Unit(s)

This is a supervised lab experience to help prepare students to meet the required standard for
qualification papers in welding codes using American Petroleum Institute (API) 1104 and American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section IX. Students will practice skills in shielded metal
arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux core arc welding (FCAW), gas tungsten
arc welding (GTAW), oxyacetylene welding (OAW), and oxy-fuel cutting (OFC) processes on several
piping systems in preparation for weld performance tests with certified welding inspectors (CWI) or
contractors. Students may enroll in this course up to 2 unit(s) to complete the entire curriculum of the
course. Pass/No Pass Only. Open Entry/Open Exit.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Follow proper safety protocols when operating welding and cutting equipment.
B. Cut, prepare, and weld various pipe joint designs.
C. Perform code level welds on open groove pipe joints.
D. Demonstrate destructive testing of welds in accordance with the API and ASME codes.
E. Follow procedures using the SMAW, GMAW, FCAW, GTAW, and OAW welding processes
meeting API and ASME specifications for qualification.
