VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the section in the textbook on Solution of Linear System by the Gauss-Jordan
Method and be able to use it to solve a system of linear equations.
2. Read the section in the textbook on Sets and be able to demonstrate the operations on a set
using a Venn diagram.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Explain in words how to set up a system of equations to use the Gauss-Jordan Method and
the process involved when using this method.
2. Describe in words how to interpret complement, intersection, and union of sets. Use Venn
diagrams in your explanation and assume you are explaining it to someone in the class
who is having trouble.
