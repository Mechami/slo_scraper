Prerequisite(s): MATH 31, PHYS 41
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

A first course in engineering mechanics: properties of forces, moments, couples and resultants; twoand three-dimensional force systems acting on engineering structures in equilibrium; analysis of
trusses, and beams; distributed forces, shear and bending moment diagrams, center of gravity,
centroids, friction, and area and mass moments of inertia. Optional additional topics include fluid
statics, cables, Mohr's circle and virtual work. (C-ID ENGR 130).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Effectively formulate and communicate legible problem solutions to be understood by engineers
in and out of their specific discipline.
B. Determine the forces that act on rigid bodies including external forces, weight, normal,
distributed loads, friction and reactions at supports.
C. Calculate internal forces in members and create shear and bending moment diagrams for beams.
D. Perform vector analysis methods addressing forces acting on rigid bodies, trusses, frames, and
machines.
E. Analyze two- and three-dimensional force systems on rigid bodies in static equilibrium.
