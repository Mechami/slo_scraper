COURSE OUTLINE
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
PHYS 10 - Concepts of Physics
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level IV; Math Level IV
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lecture

3 Unit(s)

Emphasis is placed on physics from a conceptual rather than a mathematical approach. Topics
include: Newton's Laws of Motion, energy and momentum. Depending on the students' interests,
further topics may include: Heat and Thermodynamics, Electricity and Magnetism, Light and Optics,
and Atomic and Nuclear Physics. Not intended for students who have completed high school physics
or Physics 21 or 41.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. demonstrate an understanding of concepts of thermodynamics: Laws of thermodynamics, heat
transfer.
B. demonstrate an understanding in concepts of wave theory: Vibrations and waves, sound, light.
C. apply the laws of physics to new situations.
D. demonstrate an understanding of classical mechanics concepts: Newton's laws of motion,
conservation of energy, conservation of linear momentum.
