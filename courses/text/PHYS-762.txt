PHYS 41 - Physics for Scientists and Engineers I
Prerequisite(s): MATH 30
Recommended Prep: High school physics
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

4 Unit(s)

This course, intended for students majoring in physical sciences and engineering, is part of a
three-semester course whose contents may be offered in other sequences or combinations. Core topics
include an introduction to kinematics, dynamics, work and energy, momentum, gravitation and simple
harmonic motion. It is highly recommended that students also enroll in PHYS 51. (C-ID PHYS 205).
Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Predict the future trajectory of an object moving in two dimensions with uniform acceleration.
B. Analyze a physical situation with multiple constant forces acting on a point mass using
Newtonian mechanics.
C. Analyze a physical situation with multiple forces acting on a point mass or extended object using
concepts of work and energy.
D. Analyze real-world experimental data, including appropriate use of error propagation, units and
significant figures.
E. Relate the results of experimental data to the physical concepts discussed in the lecture portion
of the class.
F. Apply concepts from special relativity to analyze physical situations, including time dilation,
length contraction, and the Lorentz transformation. Solve basic problems involving relativistic
momentum and energy.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the first chapter of special relativity text. Be prepared to participate in a discussion
regarding the differences between Galilean and Lorentz velocity transformations.
2. Read example problem and solution of the beam leaning against a frictionless wall with
given friction at the base. Prepare to solve a similar problem on a quiz.
B. Writing Assignments

B. Writing Assignments
1. Produce a written lab report on the experiment involving moments of inertia. Include a
one page summary, error propagation, calculations and properly annotated data sheet.
2. Produce a clearly written solution of the bowling ball problem including critical
assessment of numerical results.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Watch the clip of 2001 A Space Odyssey when the shuttle docks with the space station.
Estimate the rate of rotation and the physical dimensions of the station and determine,
within estimation error, if the centripetal force at the outer rim of the station is equal to
9.8m/s^2.
2. Look up the range of static friction coefficients for commercially available tires and
contrast these values with NASCAR tires.
