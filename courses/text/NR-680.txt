NR 40 - Watershed Ecology and Habitat Restoration
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level III; Math Level IV
Transfer Status: CSU
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course is an introduction to the methods, techniques, and tools used to restore and enhance
watershed health. Topics will include reforestation techniques, hydrologic cycle, disturbance
mitigation, and use of native plants for biofiltration. The course emphasizes local water issues and
restoration efforts.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Define the hydrologic cycle and explain the various processes of the cycle.
B. Identify the biologic and economic need for restoring and maintaining watershed health in
California.
C. Identify the tools and techniques of watershed restoration.
D. Demonstrate techniques for reducing erosion.
E. Compare and contrast local watersheds, and discuss land use impacts (both perceived and real)
relative to cause and effect.
F. Evaluate local restoration projects, both completed and planned, and develop and demonstrate
prescriptions for repair as a field trip activity.
G. Analyze and discuss important water issues in California.
H. List and discuss wetland and upland habitat restoration techniques using native plants and
various irrigation methods.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the chapter on ecological attributes of restored ecosystems and prepare a detailed list
of those attributes to share in class.
2. Read the article (handed out in class) on the necessity of erosion control prior to
re-vegetation of a restoration site. Be prepared to discuss the difficulties of controlling
erosion on sites after re-vegetation has begun.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Write a 5 page research paper on guidelines for restoration on different habitat types. In
your paper, explain how soil type and climate influence the species that may be present.
2. Write a short essay (500 words) on the ability of a given species to increase its population
density on restored habitat sites. Be sure to include peer-reviewed materials as references.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Attend our field trip to a logged site on the Big Chico Creek Watershed. Describe in your
notes ways that logging companies minimize soil loss through erosion and be prepared to

discuss your findings in class.
2. Attend our field trip to the Sul Norte habitat restoration site on the Sacramento River
National Wildlife Refuge. Be prepared to take notes on the irrigation system and
arrangement of the restored vegetation. Pick a particular restored plant species and be
prepared to discuss its water needs.
