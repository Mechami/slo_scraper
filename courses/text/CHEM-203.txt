CHEM 22 - Organic Chemistry II
Prerequisite(s): CHEM 21
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lecture
102 hours Lab

5 Unit(s)

This is the second course in a year-long study of organic chemistry designed for students majoring in
chemistry and related science disciplines. The physical properties, reactions and reaction mechanisms
of conjugated systems, aromatic compounds, carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic
acids and their derivatives), amines and biomolecules are studied. Laboratory work includes advanced
techniques in reaction conditions, product separation, purification and spectroscopy. (C-ID CHEM
160S) (C-ID CHEM 160S = CHEM 21 and CHEM 22). Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the fundamental principles of modern organic
chemistry.
B. Use appropriate vocabulary to describe processes and to name compounds with various
functional groups.
C. Demonstrate analytical and problem solving skills in predicting the structure of the products for
an organic reaction.
D. Demonstrate skills toward designing multi-step syntheses of organic compounds.
E. Demonstrate laboratory skills and employ standard laboratory techniques towards the synthesis,
purification and analysis of organic compounds.

D. Homework: Students are required to complete two hours of outside-of-class homework for each
unit of credit.
V. METHODS OF EVALUATION
A. Quizzes
B. Written Examinations

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the section on organometallic reactions in the textbook and be prepared to solve

synthetic and retrosynthetic problems in class and on exams.
2. Read the section on pH dependent forms of amino acids and be prepared to draw all
protonation forms and decide what the predominant form is at a given pH on exams.
B. Writing Assignments
1. For the Hydroboration experiment, create a properly formatted 1-page typed lab report
that includes a title, date, introduction, detailed procedure in third person passive voice,
formal entries for IR, NMR and MS data, and a conclusion. This report will be graded
along with your lab report.
2. Write a paragraph on an exam that explains why the hydrolysis of an ester is much more
favorable in basic conditions than in acidic conditions. Include appropriate structures with
your answer.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Complete the 1-page pre-lab assignment for the Diels Alder experiment. You will be
asked to predict the major product of the reaction, complete a data table with relevant
physical constants, and calculate the theoretical yield.
2. In order to prepare for the exam, complete the 14-page homework assignment on
electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.
