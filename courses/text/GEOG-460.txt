GEOG 21 - GIS Data Capture
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course covers design and implementation of geographic databases for Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) data capture and management. Included are essential concepts and practices of
relational database management systems, with specific application to GIS. Data is captured using
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and mobile GIS methods. GIS digitizing and editing are also
covered.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Identify the sources of existing spatial data and manipulate that data to one's needs.
B. Evaluate the quality and reliability of existing GIS data.
C. Convert digital and hard copy GIS data to needed formats.
D. Choose and apply appropriate projections and scales for given GIS data sets.
E. Access appropriate GIS data sets from the Internet.
F. Capture and manipulate data using GPS.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the chapter "Representing Spatial Objects," and prepare to discuss how the geometry
of a collected objects are displayed, how network and topology models are represented,
and how recent initiatives are standardized.
2. Read an article, from a popular or peer reviewed publication, about the current status of
geo-data acquisition, particularly focusing on the use of mobile devices and digital video.
Prepare an oral presentation for in class discussion.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Write a 750 word paper on the particular importance of projection and scale as it
associated with the scope of a particular mapping project.
2. Write a 500 word critique on the article: Free and Open Source Software for GIS
Education, as it relates to government and industrial use of open source GIS software and
other GIS products such as ESRI's ArcView.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Complete one of the three ESRI Virtual Campus courses: Working with Coordinate
Systems in ArcGIS, Basics of Map Projection, Using Lidar Data, Exploring Spatial
Patterns in Your Data, and present your certificate of completion for assignment credit.
2. Visit a public or private agency and observe the GIS application process, and present an
oral report concerning their workflow of a GIS project.
