51 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

4 Unit(s)

This course is intended for students not majoring in physics or engineering but needing a one-year
course in physics as a requirement for their major program. The course is the second part of a
two-semester sequence beginning with PHYS 21. Core topics include: electrostatics, magnetism, DC
circuits, optics and modern physics. (C-ID PHYS 110). Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Analyze simple static charge distributions and calculate the resulting electric field and electric
potential.
B. Analyze simple current distributions and calculate the resulting magnetic field.
C. Predict the trajectory of charged particles in uniform electric and magnetic fields.
D. Analyze DC circuits in terms of current, potential difference and power dissipation of each
element.
E. Analyze basic situations involving reflection and refraction, and use this analysis to predict the
path of a light ray.
F. Analyze situations involving interference and diffraction of light waves, and apply these to
situations including double slits, diffractions gratings and wide slits.
G. Understand the limitations of classical physics and begin to develop an awareness of the
importance of modern physics (i.e. quantum theory and special relativity) in the natural world.
H. Analyze real-world experimental data, including appropriate use of units and significant figures.
(Lab)
I. Relate the results of experimental data to the physical concepts discussed in the lecture portion
of the class. (Lab)

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the chapter on Faraday's Law and be prepared to discuss the principle of a
hydroelectric dam.
2. Read through the example problem in the text regarding computing the electrostatic
potential energy of a 4 charge system. Be prepared to take a quiz on a similar problem.
B. Writing Assignments
