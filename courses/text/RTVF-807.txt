Transfer Status: CSU
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course serves as an introduction to the theory and practice of audio production for radio,
television, film and digital recording applications. Students will learn the fundamentals of sound
design and aesthetics, microphone use, and digital recording equipment. Students gain hands on
experience recording, editing, mixing and mastering audio. Upon completion, students will have basic
knowledge of applied audio concepts, production workflow, equipment functions, and audio editing
software.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Understand basic physics of sound terminology; the sound wave, frequency/pitch,
amplitude/loudness, phase, and timbre.
B. Comprehend acoustics; microphone classification, placement and use; theory and practical use
of consoles, computers and software; analog/digital recording and storage devices; patching;
editing; time code; signal processors; loudspeakers.
C. Perform complex audio production techniques.
D. Describe audio production software interface.
E. Demonstrate refined techniques for audio production using Pro Tools or other appropriate audio
software.
F. Understand audio used in studio and on-location production for radio, television and film.
G. Create sound effects and original sound clips for dynamic media.
H. Collect, create, analyze, and evaluate digital audio clips.
I. Understand audio processes for voice recording, multimedia production, sound design.
J. Outline the basic process for digitizing audio clips.
K. Complete applied projects to assess the studentâ€™s knowledge of recording, editing, mixing, and
balancing.
L. Evaluate and conduct both destructive and nondestructive waveform editing procedures.
M. Explore the emotional and physical perception of music, voice and sound and the aesthetics of
audio mixing.
N. Demonstrate appropriate workplace behavior in a studio setting.
