Prerequisite(s): CSCI 48
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This is an intermediate level computer networks course covering fundamental elements, terminology
and software. It is the second of three courses (CSCI 48, 53, and 56) designed to prepare students to
take the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam. Course topics include; router elements,
binary math, TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), addressing, subnetting,
address protocols, media standards, and the design of a Local Area Network (LAN).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Identify and describe the functions of switches.
B. Identify and describe the functions of routers.
C. Define binary IP addressing, sub-netting, address protocols, media standards.
D. Identify the parts in specific protocol address examples.
E. Configure Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and define Inter-VLAN Routing.
F. Differentiate between Static and Dynamic Routing.
G. Formulate and deploy Access Control Lists (ACL).
H. Design and deploy Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Network Address
Translation (NAT) services.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the Routing Protocol Selection Guide on the Cisco Support site. Compare and
contrast the pros and cons of each routing protocol. Be prepared to discuss in class.
2. Read the white paper Defeating DDOS Attacks from the link provided by your instructor.
Be prepared to explain in class how Access Control Lists can help in prevention.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Enumerate and explain in a one (1) page document, the purpose of each of the three
operating permission environments available in Cisco Routers.
2. In a one (1) page document, explain what occurs at each step of the router boot sequence.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Analyze and compare the IP Route traces to Cisco, Yahoo, and Microsoft. Answer the
following questions: What are the differences in the traces? Why are they always the
same in the beginning? Did you discover any latency issues and if so, where? Be prepared
to share your findings in class.
2. Analyze and document your home network. Include all devices that have IP addresses or
are connected. Submit your work to the instructor.
