8 Unit(s)

This course includes pre-employment training for welding technicians. Emphasis on developing
manipulative proficiency in the use of shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding
(GMAW), and flux core arc welding (FCAW), in the flat, horizontal, vertical, and overhead positions.
These welding processes will be applied to light and heavy gauge plate steel for light construction.
Part of the Level Two welder qualification for American Welding Society (AWS).
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Practice safety skills, theory and practices used in the SMAW, GMAW and FCAW processes.
B. Demonstrate the proper use and set up of the SMAW, GMAW and FCAW processes.
C. Demonstrate the proper welding processes of bead pads, tees, and groove weld details per
qualification procedures set by the AWS.
D. Demonstrate proper joint fit-up and alignment.
E. Demonstrate proper base metal, beads and fillet welds qualification procedures per requirements
set by the AWS.
F. Identify and use the American Welding Society (AWS) classification of electrodes in selecting
the correct filler materials for the job.
G. Classify carbon steel electrodes and wires by using manufactures manuals and welding with
them.
