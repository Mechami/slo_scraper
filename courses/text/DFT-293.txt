DFT 45 - Building Information Modeling I
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: NONE
Transfer Status: CSU
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

In this computer-based course students will be introduced to the latest in three-dimensional (3D)
modeling for architecture and Building Information Modeling (BIM). Topics will cover architectural
modeling and design with BIM tools for parametric design and documentation. The focus of the course
is on residential architecture and covers the initiation of a design, the development of a design and
production of a presentation and sheet set for a design.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Describe Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the benefits of parametric associativity of
entities, model data and related details.
B. Navigate a BIM software application interface and manage views.
C. Identify, create and modify different types of building elements such as walls, stairs, doors, and
roofs.
D. Load, place, and modify component families using a BIM application.
E. Create callouts, detail views, drafting views, section views and 3D views.
F. Create and set up drawing sheets, modify title blocks, control object visibility and develop
photo-realistic (rendered) content views.
G. Import and export content to and from various other software applications and file formats to
BIM application.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Please read the handout on stairs layout and be prepared to work on the study guide at the
next scheduled class.
2. Please read the lesson on setting up an architectural floor plan. Be prepared to use Revit to
complete the lesson details at the next class.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Please open the text to page 2-1. Using AutoCAD, please complete a layout of this floor
plan with 5" walls throughout and doors and windows applied (use blocks from other
projects or make quickly). I want two things: I want the layout as a DWG file with a
Layout completed at 1/4" = 1'-0" AND I want a total time that it took you from start to
finish added to the text box of the Submission. NOTE: There will be a demo in class to
extract the TIME DATA.
2. After viewing the video with the class and using the Foundation Systems Study Guide
please complete the study guide questions and fill-ins and turn into the instructor at the
end of the period.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Using your favorite search engine (Google, Yahoo, Bing, DogPile, etc.) please research
the term "Revit families". Spend some time in at least the top 10 search results. Please
provide me with a list of at least FIVE families that you found content for that are of

provide me with a list of at least FIVE families that you found content for that are of
interest to you.
2. Outside of class and using Revit, please take the initial floorplan layout provided as an
attachment and layout the floorplan using ALL of the same settings you are currently
assigned to use for the two-story residence. Bring the initial layout back to class and be
prepared to complete in Revit.
