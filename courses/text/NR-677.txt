This course is an introduction to the integrated management of natural resources including trees, soil,
water, fish, and wildlife for the production of wood and fiber products. The emphasis will be on both
the traditional and emerging uses of the forest resource to satisfy human needs and the consequent
protection of the public trust. Basic biological and ecological processes will be introduced along with
discussion of the scientific method and preparing reports.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Assess the importance of forest products and other natural resources to our society.
B. Examine the effects of early forest policy and regulations on the resources.
C. Identify and describe the basic principles of ecological succession in terms of multiple and
sustainable use of natural resources.
D. Evaluate the factors that influence the health of an ecosystem.
E. Describe the major functions and significance of watersheds and illustrate basic principles of
watershed restoration.
F. Evaluate past and present efforts of agencies to prevent wildfires.
G. Apply the basic principles of silviculture including practices of measuring, evaluating,
managing and manipulating forest, wildlife, range, and water resources for human uses and
values.
