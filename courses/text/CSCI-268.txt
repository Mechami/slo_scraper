VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the procedure for implementing a Distributed File System (DFS) Server Role. Using
the handout provided by the instructor, create a DFS and summarize a back up, recovery,
and access method for the DFS. Be prepared to demonstrate the procedure and steps in
class on your server.
2. Read the chapter on Patch Management. Consider the implications of a poorly planned
management scheme. What are the ramifications? Prepare to discuss in class.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Using a hypothetical enterprise scenario provided by your instructor, determine the Group
Policy needs of 4 different departments and provide an example of Account/Group policy
settings, configuration and management. Explain in detail the reasoning behind your
policy implementation choices.
2. List the steps required to enable Disk Encryption and explain in detail (2-3 pages) the
benefits and/or issues that might arise by doing so.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Research how Domain Name Services (DNS) works, and is implemented in a
non-Windows environment. Compare it to Active Directory DNS and summarize the

similarities and differences. Which is easier to manage and maintain? Be prepared to
present your findings to the class.
2. Select and complete a Microsoft Virtual Lab online. Compare and contrast your
experience in the virtual lab with the labs you have completed in the physical lab
environment. Be prepared to discuss your thoughts in class.
