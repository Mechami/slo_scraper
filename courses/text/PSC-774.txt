4 Unit(s)

This is an Honors level course in the study of our dynamic universe. Through a process of thorough
analysis, critical thinking, extended discussions, and original oral and written responses, students will
establish connections between the principle-based methods of the hard sciences and our understanding
of the fundamental questions of the cosmos and our place in it. Issues covered include the history of
astronomy, the science of observation and discovery, stellar birth, maturation and death, planetary
formation, a description of our solar system galaxies, quasars, and cosmology. Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Analyze and synthesize significant global ideas and primary original works and writing.
B. Demonstrate critical thinking skills in seminar-type discussions.
C. Demonstrate advanced writing skills and critical, creative thinking in composing a minimum of
5000 words in analytical papers and reading responses.
D. Generate creative, original responses to course material.
E. Describe the basic motion of objects we see in the sky, such as the sun, moon, stars, planets,
comets, meteors and meteor showers.
F. Discuss the basic history of astronomy to include Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and
Newton as well as the geocentric versus the heliocentric model.
G. Demonstrate an understanding of the basic laws of motion, optics, and the electromagnetic
spectrum related to energy, wavelength, and spectroscopy.
H. Diagram the solar system and be able to discuss similarities and differences between Earth and
other solar system bodies.
I. Outline the process of energy production in the Sun and the path of travel of this energy to
Earth.
J. Compare and contrast the life cycle of a one solar mass star with a twenty solar mass star.

VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read sources including NASA documents, European Space Agency releases, newspaper
accounts, and other primary sources of a current incident or event and be prepared for
class discussion.
2. Review and critique Ward and Brownlee's book, Rare Earth, and refute or support their
hypothesis in a class discussion.
B. Writing Assignments
1. Research an ancient culture and write three pages about its fundamental worldview on
astronomy. Discuss both the practical importance of astronomy and the importance it had
for religious or other traditions.
2. Compose a 3-page essay in which you summarize a NASA mission; discuss if the mission
achieved its goals and critique the cost-to-benefit of the mission.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Observe and sketch the phases of the moon every night for one month. Organize your
observations and construct a comprehensive diagram showing the locations of the sun,
Earth, and moon for the phases you observed on each Sunday.
2. Attend an academic seminar and/or visit an observatory or museum on a subject related to
astronomy, and write a 2-page explanation of how the event reflected or challenged the
concepts we have been exploring this semester.
