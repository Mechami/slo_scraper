I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
CHEM 1 - General Chemistry I
Prerequisite(s): CHEM 110 or one year of high school chemistry; Math Level V
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level IV
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
51 hours Lecture
102 hours Lab

5 Unit(s)

This course introduces students to the basic principles of chemistry with a quantitative emphasis.
Topics include atomic theory, chemical bonding, molecular geometry, chemical reactions,
stoichiometry, gases, thermochemistry, intermolecular forces and solutions. This is the first semester
of a one-year course in chemistry intended for majors in the natural sciences (chemistry, biochemistry,
biology, physics, pre-medicine), mathematics, and engineering. The two-semester sequence of CHEM
1 and CHEM 2 provides the basic chemical background needed for further investigations into our
physical environment. (C-ID CHEM 110/120S). Graded only.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Demonstrate basic experimental knowledge by employing standard lab techniques for data
gathering, judging the accuracy and reliability of data, creating informative graphs, and
discussing the limitations of experimental designs.
B. Demonstrate basic analytical skills by interpreting graphs and schematics and diagnosing
realistic physical problems.
C. Demonstrate conceptual understanding by being able to describe qualitatively the underlying
causes of basic physical and chemical phenomena.

C. Laboratory Experiments
D. Laboratory Exercises
E. Students are required to complete two hours of outside-of-class homework for each course unit
V. METHODS OF EVALUATION
A. Quizzes
B. Written Examinations
C. Laboratory Reports and Exercises
VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the section on stoichiometry in the text. Be prepared to solve a related problem on a
test.
2. Read the section on relationships among variables describing gases in the text. Be
prepared to discuss the relationships in class.
B. Writing Assignments
1. For the experiment on stoichiometry, create a properly formatted report in your lab
notebook. The report must include the title, date, a clear statement of purpose, an
overview or procedure, complete data results tables, and a conclusion based on your
observations.
2. Write a paragraph on the use of kinetic molecular theory to explain why the pressure of a
gas increases as temperature increases while holding number of particles and volume

constant.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. After reviewing the section on stoichiometry in the text, complete the assigned homework
problems at the end of the chapter.
2. After reading the experiment on pressure temperature relationships in gases, complete the
corresponding prelab assignment by graphing the sample data and analyzing the graph to
estimate the value of absolute zero.
