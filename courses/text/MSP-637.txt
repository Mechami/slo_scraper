COURSE OUTLINE
I. CATALOG DESCRIPTION
MSP 45 - 3-D Computer Modeling and Animation
Prerequisite(s): NONE
Recommended Prep: Reading Level IV; English Level III
Transfer Status: CSU/UC
34 hours Lecture
51 hours Lab

3 Unit(s)

This course introduces students to the use of software techniques to create and animate
three-dimensional environments and objects. Students will learn to create photo-realistic models and
scenes enhanced by lighting, shadows, reflection, and textures, and will learn to produce camera
fly-throughs and basic character animation sequences.
II. OBJECTIVES
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
A. Demonstrate skills in 3D model construction, texture and color, environmental construction,
lighting point of view (camera placement), and movement sequencing.
B. Create a portfolio of 3D models and animations suitable for potential employers.
C. Identify employment opportunities in the 3D design industry.
