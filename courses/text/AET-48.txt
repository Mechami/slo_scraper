VI. EXAMPLES OF ASSIGNMENTS
A. Reading Assignments

A. Reading Assignments
1. Read the chapter on pumps in FOS Hydraulics before class meets. Complete study
questions at end of the chapter and be prepared to discuss them in class.
2. Read the sections on air brake fundamentals of the Bendix Air Brake Handbook before
class meets. Be prepared to discuss these concepts in class.
B. Writing Assignments
1. At the end of class complete the daily Lab Report form to review the topic presented and
answer the 3 questions evaluating your understanding of it briefly but fully. Return the
white copy to the instructor- keep the pink copy for your reference.
2. List the steps for the in-cab air brake test in correct sequence. Be prepared in class to be
able to relate them accurately in the correct order. You will also be required to perform
this test in the truck from memory.
C. Out-of-Class Assignments
1. Locate and identify 5 hydraulic components on the John Deere 7405 tractor. Be prepared
in class to do this from memory.
2. Complete the Dual Circuit air brake diagram by properly connecting all components. Be
prepared in class to do this from memory.
