# SLOScraper

## Context

The SLOScraper is the task assigned to Butte College's Programming Project class for Spring 2019, the capstone course for the Computer Programming AS degree.

## Purpose

The purpose of the SLOScraper is to scrape the Butte College website's [list of academic programs](butte.edu/academicprograms) for data and store it in an authoritative database.

For each program, we will collect:
* The program's name
* The program's type (AA, AS, CERT, etc.)
* The program learning outcomes (PLOs)

This information will then be sent to the database to be stored.

## Going Forward

For future Programming Project classes, there is more to do to enhance the SLOScraper. Namely, the student learning outcomes (SLOs) for all Butte College courses should also be scraped and stored in the database. Also, as version 1 of the SLOScraper is used and adopted, there will undoubtedly be bugs or usability issues that should be fixed.
